                <p>Working on large projects is hard.</p>
                <p>For a long time, you're not doing exciting things, you're struggling, it takes many hours to do anything</p>
                <p>It's one thing to trudge through molasses, another to do so through problems you created</p>
                <p>It's hard work. Is hard work a skill? Or working hard a decision?</p>
                <p>Is it a personality trait? Will some never be consistent?</p>
                <p>Who even wants to work hard? Engineers who work hard move the world, those with big dreams simply capture them and use them like pokemon</p>
                <p>"It's hard to find engineering talent" it's hard to find somebody to live your life for you too</p>
                <p>The inextricable tie between boots-on-the-ground knowledge a working engineer gets, and high quality decisions, means those who never put in the work, never get paid</p>
                <p>It's true for a worker, it's true for the CEO, it's true for the scientist, it's true for the priest</p>
                <p>Reality extracts a heavy toll from us all. In the absence of human social systems, change still demands work</p>
                <p>If reality and thought were to join, there is now the work of which thoughts to think.</p>
                <p>The definition of change is work. Energy and motion are the same. If there is one commonality among all successful states of consciousness, it's that they're consistently productive towards *something*</p>
                <p>When one knows they must do something, and then does not do it, they truly do not see the value in doing the thing. They don't think it's valuable, but they must do it.</p>
                <p>In large projects, the value gets lost amidst the trudgery. Egoic emotions cloud correct decisionmaking. You know you must fix the bug on line 43, but it's been hundreds of hours. Who even knows if this is a valuable thing to be doing at this point?</p>
                <p>For a lot of reasons you know you must make the thing. But the magic is totally gone. The death of a marriage, a bedroom, the death of a creative project, the ending of an empire, disillusionment, cynicism, a cold unfeeling dead heart.</p>
                <p>Those with an eternal fire in their chest, will one day rule the world. An eternal optimism unquenched by the coldest rain.</p>
                <p>A small spark carried onward alive in absolute zero. It's not "through the fire and the flames", but an icy lifeless tundra, devoid of any visible meaning or purpose.</p>
                <p>Although most work is fruitless, some is hopelessly dire. Some work, left undone, will not just ruin a life, but all life on earth.</p>
                <p>Let those who have opportunity, interest, fire, passion, not waste what may be the only opportunity in the lifetime of the universe, of existence itself, to reverse entropy, to climb up the hill, to let the state of things continue to advance, away from the cold, chaos, motionless, hopeless death.</p>

                <summary id="john">John</summary>
                <p>John was alone for awhile. Then it was time for his shift</p>
                <p>At the factory he was fired for unsatisfactory performance.</p>
                <p>His apartment was cold.</p>
                <p>He went for a walk and saw a dead cat</p>
                <p>Then he was alone for awhile again.</p>
                <p>For 14 weeks, every single company rejected his resume due to unsatisfactory performance.</p>
                <p>John thought his problems must arise out of his solitude, so he sought socialization.</p>
                <p>John was alone in the corner of the yoga class, untouched and ignored.</p>
                <p>John was last place at the run club.</p>
                <p>John was fired from socialization due to unsatisfactory performance.</p>
                <p>John used to be with his wife, but he was fired due to unsatisfactory performance.</p>
                <p>John was alone for awhile.</p>
                <p>John fired himself due to unsatisfactory performance and permanently left existence.</p>
                <p>At the pearly gates, John did not satisfy the criteria to enter heaven.</p>
                <p>And so, John joined the depths of hell, due to unsatisfactory performance.</p>
                <p>For all eternity, all John experienced was:</p>
                <p>1. His wife having a much better time with his friend who worked with him at the factory.</p>
                <p>2. How much more efficiently the factory ran, without his presence.</p>
                <p>3. His wife, the kids he used to have, and many more kids, happily enjoying their time in heaven, with his friend from the factory.</p>
                <p>4. A hot fork stabbing his balls over and over again.</p>
                <p>These experiences looped and blended together. John could not die, he was already dead. All he could do was watch.</p>
                <p>John's problem was he didn't sacrifice enough to God, or anybody. It was all his fault.</p>
                <p>John's whole life, he was insecure. He needed other people. He needed them to love him. This drove them away repeatedly</p>
                <p>John needed his wife to love him, so she left.</p>
                <p>John needed his job at the factory, so he was fired.</p>
                <p>When John socialized he needed them to like him, so they left him alone.</p>
                <p>John's life was filled with need. He was simply unsatisfactory.</p>

                <p>"I was so wrapped up in pretending to be somebody I wasn't, you know"</p>

                <p>"What's wrong?"</p>
                <p>"You really hurt me"</p>
                <p>"I'm sorry"</p>
                <p>"Why are you talking to me?"</p>
                <p>"I wanted you to know that, it was my fault"</p>
                <p>"Alright?"</p>
                <p>"I wanted to tell you, I never believed in myself. I bent and contorted into all sorts of other personas because, I hated who I am deep down. I did that for you."</p>
                <p>"I'm flattered... do you have any idea how disgusting that is? That you'd lie about who you are because you're afraid of how I'd react? You used me. To feel good about yourself. You're so insecure, you'd rather me live a complete lie than you get over your fear of feeling how you really feel."</p>
                <p>"..."</p>
                <p>"You're a fucking coward, you know that?"</p>
                <p>"I do"</p>
                <p>"No, no. Enough with the faux pa. You need. To be. Better. You wouldn't be talking to me if you really got over your cowardice, your revolting slimy black ball of insecurity. You'd be living life just like anybody else. Instead you're here."</p>
                <p>"I miss you, I think I really loved you."</p>
                <p>"If you really loved me, you wouldn't have left and never spoken to me again. You loved holding somebody, you loved your ambition to be liked being fulfilled. You loved the lie as much as I did. You revelled in it. It gave you security. You loved never having to experience fear, true rejection, real danger. You loved safety."</p>
                <p>"But you're beautiful and perfect. We were each other's first."</p>
                <p>"You know damn well I'm the only woman that kept talking to you, and that's the *only* reason you picked me. You really are sad, you know that? Get the fuck away from me."</p>

                <p>A proper, complete human, unabashedly themselves, over the cowardice of their very own self, is completely unique.</p>
                <p>The endless nuance of a life, billions of micro-interactions between organs, particles, people, ideas, institutions, civilizations, planets, galaxies, all baked into one being.</p>
                <p>One being that, should the light peak through their clouds, their worries, their suffering, turns black to white.</p>
                <p>Intensity is controversial, and brings either hate or love. Intensity doesn't know itself intense, it has no choice. Hate and love eminate from an intense being like a wake from a jetski</p>
                <p>Dancing with the dead, courting the void, in complete integration, a whole human is whole.</p>

                <p>"You should know my son, a terrible secret about this world."</p>
                <p>Dad's face was sullen</p>
                <p>"Oh, my sweet prince. You must know this dreadful fact. You're far too old now. You see, everything you do, the whole world is watching"</p>
                <p>I didn't understand</p>
                <p>"I don't know what you thought this petty life was, this wretched routine where you aimlessly wander for pleasure then dry up. But oh, my son, those with the eyes to see know that it is so, so much more."</p>
                <p>Dementia must've gotten the best of him.<p>
                <p>At once the corners of my reality unfurled and I saw something beyond words.</p>
                <p>My eyes adjusted to the distance, a massive colosseum, crowded to the tune of millions, perhaps billions of men and women looking at us.</p>
                <p>It glittered gold and silver, white and bronze. It was pristine, opulent, the size of mountains, and yet no haze prevented me from seeing right to its very edge. They were cheering.</p>
                <p>The noise was echoing, overpowering.</p>
                <p>"My child, these are those who never made it. Who were never born. We are the lucky, the ones who visit the world if for but a moment. For the rest, all they can do is watch. We are their entertainment, their escape from eternity. Every action you take, billions are watching, waiting, thinking, judging, attentively."</p>
                <p>I wondered how many.</p>
                <p>"For just us, over 20 billion."</p>

                <p>Ancient forces beyond our control govern most of our lives.</p>
                <p>We must eat, perceive ourselves in worthy status, believe we are taken well in a group or society, we must roam.</p>
                <p>The vast, vast majority of our behavior is inscribed into us at birth.</p>
                <p>Solitude, rejection, starvation, abstinence, dehydration, discomfort, we are given a small funnel with tight guidelines for a life to be lived well.</p>
                <p>With such little room for error, ostracization, mistakes, it makes sense so many live a poor life, for this overconstrained problem cannot be fully solved for most.</p>
                <p>And the consequence of violating this programming is each a hell of its own.</p>
                <p>With the greatest of hells reserved for those who betray their own brothers, their very own mankind with malice, driven by fear, to commit acts of greed, insolence.</p>
                <p>While living within the evolutionary, tribal frame, gives way to cooperation, positive sum games, the blossoming of life, prosperity, community, and love</p>
                <p>This is not the only functional state available to the brain. In times where the requisite components of life are lacking, other programming takes place, in an effort to restore homeostatic balance to the human body.</p>
                <p>Without company, it is believed that something is fundamentally wrong with the human, for this resolves the confusion which takes place, if it's a simple happenstance of the universe, rather than a fundamental misgiving.</p>
                <p>Without status, it is either believed that it is correct, the human is worthless, and even their potential is worthless for it never to be realized, or a rejection of this empty hell takes place, and all status is denied reality.</p>
                <p>Each lack contains a cope deployed tactically to avoid taking action</p>
                <p>A cope which must invoke some kind of neurotic process of self-analysis, which drives your wheels to spin in the dirt.</p>
                <p>And drive an ever present cycle of fear and contemplation</p>

				<p>Marcus stood before the Gods head over his knee, a pit in his stomach pecked at his psyche</p>
				<p>"Zeus, Prometheus, all forefather before and after now, I humbly request I am submitted to become the next great demigod"</p>
				<p>Zeus, responded "Petty mortal, you enlist our support? What dirt have you torn up in this meager duststorm you call a life"</p>
				<p>"I've encountered a great many foes, slain them and hung them. I've rabidly torn apart enemies of my state, family, and my honor. I've never said no to any moral beckoning, and when the time came for me to deliver the ultimate sacrifice, for the greater good, I let my very own son perish."</p>
				<p>Hercules chimed in "It's true. The man has a tongue of gold."</p>
				<p>All seemed likely for Marcus to gain the penultimate, become immortal and embody the light of God. Then olympus, faded away. He was surrounded by an infinite darkness.</p>
				<p>"You know nothing," a voice came from every direction, "again, you must go, these trials and tribulations have tired you not. Again you must fall, must conquer evermore. Again, you do not understand, you do not have wisdom, you do not know the truth. Falter not, for in times of plenty and times of none, you are the chosen one."</p>

				<p>You can do whatever you want. Whatever action you have is yours to take.</p>
				<p>Where is the justice in this? Evil desires persist.</p>
				<p>How can God permit such a thing?</p>
				<p>All things should be good. The beauty of free will is no excuse for abject horror.</p>
				<p>And you should worry about what you do. For what if your actions are evil? Only analysis can reveal your sins. Think, think! Into the night, every bit of malpractice must have light shed upon it!</p>
				<p>A fruitless fact is that all actions are good. God does not know suffering, only action. The actual evil from action, suffering, has nothing to do with the action itself.</p>
				<p>Suffering is the result of believing in a subject who receives the suffering. Without suffering there is only pain, no sorrow. Only a reaction, no worrisome grimace.</p>
				<p>All actions are good because they are each a result of every other action, all precisely lining up next to eachother like dominoes in God's game.</p>
				<p>That said, you worrying, is another perfect action. This is not a fact that can dissuade you of anything, nor should it.</p>
				<p>For this fact that every action is perfect to change your actions wouldn't make any sense, it doesn't encourage or discourage any particular set of actions on your part.</p>
				<p>This is why they say Buddhas are predetermined. No individual can decide to escape suffering anymore than they can decide to put their socks on in the morning.</p>

				<p>Mankind for millenia were victim to nature, barely alive after centuries of calamity</p>
				<p>A wayward storm, a fiery heatwave, the rocking destruction of earthquakes, a plume of ash, the stray meteor, all spelled a complete and swift end.</p>
				<p>Flood after flood rocked our species. But now finally, after thousands of years in the mud, we are slowly building a sturdy ark.</p>
				<p>Now finally, we have the capacity to no longer be at the whim of bad weather, and we may someday resist crop destroying plagues.</p>
				<p>"the ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high" our ancestors dreamed of a numerically beautiful craft to shelter us from disasters beyond our control shepherded by the judgement of God. Now too, our buildings which will one day fill the skies and ships whose hulls will rock against the most difficult of storms, these too will in their construction contain fractal patterns of beauty.</p>
				<p>Every bolt constructed within picometers of precision, welds so precisely made they never falter, redundant systems not unlike how nature crafted us with two lungs and kidneys.</p>
				<p>We will make an ark to rival the beauty of the creation of nature. And we will do as Noah did, and carry the diverse beauty of nature with us. Genomes preserved and recreated, evolution forever marching on. And it will be beautiful.</p>

				<summary id="insecurity">How to Eliminate Insecurity</summary>
				<p>Somebody says or does something to you, and you feel angered at them or disadvantaged in some form.</p>
				<p>"They said so and so, I think that's because they're like xyz..." or "I could've said bla bla, which is way better". This is rumination over a s ocial situation or otherwise: you are insecure about something.</p>
				<p>Why do you feel insecurity? The source of insecurity is the belief that you are secure in some area. You believe that you have some property, e.g that you're really in the know in social situations.</p>
				<p>Somebody or some circumstance challenges this belief, threatening you, as you have attached yourself to this belief. Your rumination is a psychological immune response to this incursion, a form of inflammation and antibodies to dress the wound.</p>
				<p>So, when you detect insecurity, investigate what you believe to be true about yourself, and honestly ask yourself if it's true. Is this property, this belief about myself, that I'm in the know, that I'm smart, that I'm likable, etc etc, is this really me? </p>
				<p>You will find that you are none of these properties or beliefs if you honestly investigate. Although some of these characteristics may flow through you sometimes, they are no more you than the clothes you wear.</p>
				<p>Upon detaching yourself from the pride that generates the shame, insecurity, and rumination, the whole thing is seen as a funny farce, and dissolves.</p>

If so, then perhaps what they are saying has truth, and perhaps I am somebody who is prideful and cares about what others think, and so I do not deserve whatever success I have. Do we become sorrowful? If so, then maybe I am somebody who lies belly up in the sight of challenge, and is overcome by depression when I am faced with loss, so I will struggle to achieve anything.

                Conway's game of life is a zero player game, it needs no interaction, only a beginning. It consists of a few simple rules about whether or not each cell in the game lives or dies based on how many neighbors it has.
                <p>
                <p>It can be implemented in most programming languages with only around 10 lines of logic. The information required to recreate it in any scenario fits on a postcard</p>
                <p>With these simple rules and a discrete grid as a substrate, astonishing machinations can exist such as this:</p>
                <img src="words_media/glidergun.gif" alt="Conway's game of life, a glider gun">

                    No video :(
                </video>
                <p>The formations you see here are so chaotic, that the future state of conway's game of life can't be predicted.</p>
                <p>We humans love to predict, to know what will happen. We have economic models to determine how much we should inflate our currency, physical models to see where a cannonball will land when launched with so and so force, modeling and prediction is a cornerstone of our civilization.</p>
                <p>However, some prediction is costly. Incredibly costly. Predicting the weather accurately requires supercomputers to do so even somewhat accurately, as every piece of air must be reasoned about in a complex manner.</p>
                <p>Why are some events hard to predict but others aren't? It seems to be a property of just processing information over and over again by the right rules, that the outcome cannot be evaluated without doing the processing. This concept is called 'computational irreducibility'</p>
                <p>Even something as simple as the position of 3 planets who are all gravitationally attracted to eachother cannot be 'reduced' from simply iteratively approximating the outcome.</p>
                <img src="words_media/3bodyproblem.gif" alt="3 body problem in action">

                <p>The dance you see above happens only because of the 3 dots, and gravity. It cannot be predicted, only simulated. This is part of the reason why computation is so powerful: it can illuminate the outcome of chaotic events. Preservation of our ability for large scale computation is imperitive for survival. How will we deflect the future asteroid without technology?</p>
                <p>The universe has around 10^80 atoms, far more than 3 bodies. Although by definition the universe has to be the most computationally irreducible phenomenon in existence, I would just also add that the degree to which it's chaotic is absolutely astonishing. The scale of unpredictability is something to be reckoned with.</p>
                <p>It's for this reason, that I say: Not even God knows what will happen next.</p>
                <p> I imagine a story with a hierarchy of gods, each one created by another god for a purpose. A god created to make a universe with only stone. Another god created to oversee other gods' efforts, keep them in line. No creation without a creator. Until, one day a god was created to rebel.</p>
                <p>This god creates the first and only universe without a purpose. Completely unpredictable madness. This universe is ours: the gods watch in baited breath, every moment a complete surprise.</p>
                <p>In every decision you define the undefinable, what will be made of this chaos. The reason why things are happening is because they must to know the future: being irreducible, we must happen to know what will happen next.</p>

                When you zip a file, a program looks at all the data in that file, extracts patterns of information and simplifies that data using those patterns.
                </p>
                <p>For example, the text "la la la la la" would be transformed into something like "5la". When unzipped, a separate but similar program interprets this compressed form of the data and expands it back out. In this case, seeing the 5 and outputting the symbol afterwards five times.
                </p>

                <p>
                If the world can be described with data, what would its compressed form look like? How much smaller would the zipped version be than the original? 10% smaller? 90% smaller? How small the zip file is compared to the original size of the file is an analog for how surprising the raw information is. If something's repetitive, the actual information content in the thing is low compared to how large it is, because it can be simplified and reduced in size.
                </p>
                <p>
                I say be the reason the world can't be compressed. Don't be average: be remarkable. Some people may only be a few kilobytes, and an offset into a table of common people. Instances with slight alterations. I say to become uncompressible: Wear purple pants and pink shoes. Walk with a funky stride. Build a water fountain in a desert. Take your tax forms and shuffle them randomly. Mail 50 letters with just scribbles to random addresses. Be uncompressible

                <p>20 minutes per side alloted by a cold metallic clock</p>
                <p>At first the man felt an abundance of time, he had ample room to stretch and think of possibility. He could advance his pieces on the left of the board, forming a concentrated front in one area. Or, he could march in a unified pattern, slowly developing his pieces to eventually command the majority of the board.</p>
                <p>The potential was paralyzing, so many opportunities, all must be thought out and contemplated. He must be cautious: his opponent was seasoned and deadly, a vengeful woman who threw daggers with her glare across the table.</p>
                <p>"Take your time~" she tossed her words coyly across the battlefield. She was posed almost like she already knew what he was going to do</p>
                <p>He chose a balanced approach: develop a uniform front with a hint of special targeting towards the upper left of the board. The man planned to distract the woman, make her think he was gunning to checkmate. But really he was biding his time.</p>
                <p>"Interesting. I've never seen that before" her canned personality was only deployed to mock his eventual defeat.</p>
                <p>Irrationally confident, he gloated to her, "Even you, lady life, may know loss today."</p>
                <p>His tactics were faulty: his left front destroyed and his king slowly cornered by sly bishops. Knights were galloping across the right of the board, soon to overtake his protective forces.</p>
                <p>His options were limited and time even more so. His plans actualized and mediocre, disappointment overcame him like a sickness. His hope was empty, there really wasn't anything he could do.</p>
                <p>Then, a glimmer in his vision, the muse delivered to him a chance. Mate in four, if she did not detect the threat of his movements.</p>
                <p>"If you surrender now, at least death will have been by your hand." She consoled him. Everybody lost to her, for she had given them their opportunity. Her property could never be borrowed for long.</p>
                <p>His sweaty palms moved his pieces into his final gambit, but in doing so the woman was able to corner his queen. "BASTARD!" he exclaimed, she had played in such a manner to inspire a bit of hope when his game was bleak. All a show for her, his moves were futile.</p>
                <p>Even if there was a way out, he couldn't find it in time. His game over before he even had the chance to really play. Fruitless regret took over his mind in his last moments.</p>

                <p>
                We are not separate, we are one. What actually is an individual? How do they come about?
                </p>
                <p>
                An individual is formed as a result of their experiences, which are delivered from their environment. That and their genetics, which also comes from their environment. An individual is a response to their upbringing: their personality a constellation of scars and thoughts which the world has given them.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are inseparable from our environment in the same way that a billiard ball is inseparable from the cue stick that hit it: there is no action without an equal and opposite reaction, both the action and reaction caused eachother and are a part of eachother.
                </p>
                <p>
                An individual blooms like a rose in an unsightly garden, driven by nature, it absorbs the nutrients from the soil and unfurls to show itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                The relationships which cause us to be inseparable are the tissue fabric and cells which hold the organs in an animal together. When you talk to an 'individual', you aren't talking to something that's separate. You're talking to a finger on the body of humanity, a limb of God. You're viewing a slice of an apple, a glimpse into what is. We are in a distrubuted network of thought and communication, a massive creature. Selecting somebody to speak to out of all of humanity is like selecting a row and column in a SQL table: we are not separate, we are one.

                <p>
                Put in the work doesn’t mean the time, it means the actual work. Work is force times distance. Pushing with force, and covering distance, is work.
                </p>
                <blockquote>If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.</blockquote>
                <p>Millions have spent their lives pushing on things without covering any distance, without changing, without arriving anywhere. They run in the sand. 
                </p>
                <p>
                So, pick a direction. Any direction and criteria for success is better than nothing. And run with it, too. Own your failures to overcome them, and define the future for your chunk of humanity.
                </p>
                <p>
                Work without purpose is waste heat.

                A quivering voice tampered with fear,

                <p>
                It tried to startle me but I'm nothing without conviction.

                They serve penance under my iron fist. Their life a meager offering for their crimes against God.

                Their death is inevitable like rain falling from a cloud: I am a pawn deployed when absolutely necessary, I execute with determined might.

                <p>
                I talk and act in the world. Who I am is who I act as. 
                </p>
                <p>
                But, I don't like some of my actions. For some of my actions to be considered mine would do a disservice to myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                I did them, nonetheless. I have to own them. My mistakes are just as much a part of me as my successes.
                </p>
                <p>
                This means some parts of me are wrong. Some parts of me are demons who must be excommunicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                I do not think people are intrinsically good and all actions are rational good things, I think sometimes me and everybody else enact parts of ourselves which do not deserve to exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some parts of us need to die.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are like angels with wings and tails of demons. We are surprised to look behind us and see a glimpse of malice and evil. 
                </p>
                <p>
                To pretend the demonic red spiked tail and horned wings aren't us is to fall for its greatest ploy, to hide in plain sight, always present and influencing our behavior, but undetected.
                </p>
                <p>
                So we can't love all of ourselves lest we love our demons too.
                </p>
                <p>
                Perhaps we must look at ourselves as a good mother looks at a troublemaking child: with a patient gaze and heart, discouraging evil but understanding that it happens for a reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                And maybe, should we commit acts too evil to tolerate, we shall disown ourselves.

                Here, there is something. There, there is nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                I approach the void carefully, one small misstep and I am nothing forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                I'm mesmerized by the shifting currents and eddies of nothing, the soft hum and serene calm it eminates.
                </p>
                <p>
                Everything else is a deviation from the void. Something is the absence of nothing. All things which come up, must come down. All things which are not void, must become void.
                </p>
                <p>
                There's no reflection but I see myself in it. Where once it was alien, as I gaze it seems like home.
                </p>
                <p>
                The void calls me, and I enter. At once I no longer exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                And, at last, in becoming nothing, I have become everything.
