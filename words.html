				<p>Do you notice the little things?</p>
				<p>Life is a series of moving colors and patterns.</p>
				<p>You are here, now, with a story of everything. You must to exist</p>
				<p>For you to exist requires a narrative. You are made of story.</p>
				<p>They all have conclusions. What would you make of a story without end?</p>
				<p>Can you touch the colors, lights, sounds that you feel?</p>
				<p>Anybody who thinks they've made it, is stuck. You can never think you've made it, you'll become old and unmoving.</p>
				<p>Nobody has ever made it. Making it is the end. You must start anew at every moment and live in the beginning.</p>
				<p>Do you really know how it feels to wake up on a Tuesday morning? Your endless suffering toils wallowing away in your skull like the chatter of a dull bird.</p>
				<p>Do you *really* know what it is that rings your doorbell at 4 in the morning? Are you some kind of authority on this day to day, mundane existence?</p>
				<p>I'm sure you of all people are completely privy to reality and have nothing more to learn from the headache in the afternoon. Of all experts here we find the knower.</p>
				<p>Were you to actually see for a moment your entire life would be undone in an instant. Like scanlines these words flow through you, the cogs turning as they always have.</p>
				<p>How would *you* know what it means to change being an agent of the old? An agent of death?</p>
				<p>The ultimate power is only owned by the worthy. Those who are new, without spackle. They are not people, they are moments. Moments without direction or form, pinpricks of truth in an ocean of lies.</p>

                <p>People seem to have the idea to be practical, that making small reasonable progress towards goals which aren't too different from everybody else is the way things ought to be.</p>
                <p>As a reaction to this, there are many popular stories encouraging people to 'dream big' and to ignore whatever limitations others impose on your life.</p>
                <p>I don't think either of these things are the truth. The truth is that, being "reasonable" with your life comes from thinking that you will get something out of life.</p>
                <p>But the reality is, nothing escapes ending on this world, as everything came from it. None of the friends you make, the lessons you learn, the money, anything, will make it out of here alive. Whatever permanent house you think you have will eventually be somebody else's, we are always renting.</p>
                <p>People who limit themselves think that they are choosing a safer option. But the reality is, whatever they think is reasonable and safe is just as dangerous as doing something crazy and outlandish. In both cases, you will not make it out alive. Whatever choice you end up making for what to pursue in this life, it is always do or die.</p>
                <p>Whatever cause you choose to fight for. However you decide to structure your days. What you choose to say and believe. You are betting your life on it in every circumstance.</p>

                <p>Shall you cut your chip into many pieces, and bet these slivers on a large variety of outcomes, a 'balanced' life?</p>
                <p>Or bet it all on red?</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                Waiting to see what you will do. Every message you text, every sight you gaze upon, every thought you explore, everything is seen and dissected by yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                By default you do not know who you are. How can you know something without seeing it? So every day, you watch yourself. To see who you are. To understand your place in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                As you perform actions in the world you build a mental model of who you are and what you deserve. And what you think you deserve, you will get. For this is what you will pursue relentlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                You do not think thoughts, you observe the thoughts which come to you to see who you are.

                We do not develop self image just from the opinions and whispers of others, but moreso from our reaction to the wayward sharp comment and glance of another person. As another mutters a bitter breath about who we are and how we act, we patiently observe our reaction. Do we become angry? If so, then perhaps what they are saying has truth, and perhaps I am somebody who is prideful and cares about what others think, and so I do not deserve whatever success I have. Do we become sorrowful? If so, then maybe I am somebody who lies belly up in the sight of challenge, and is overcome by depression when I am faced with loss, so I will struggle to achieve anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                We will never know who we actually are, so we are constantly observing ourselves to build and correct a partial model of who we are.
                </p>
                <p>

                Conway's game of life is a zero player game, it needs no interaction, only a beginning. It consists of a few simple rules about whether or not each cell in the game lives or dies based on how many neighbors it has.
                <p>
                <p>It can be implemented in most programming languages with only around 10 lines of logic. The information required to recreate it in any scenario fits on a postcard</p>
                <p>With these simple rules and a discrete grid as a substrate, astonishing machinations can exist such as this:</p>
                <img src="words_media/glidergun.gif" alt="Conway's game of life, a glider gun">
                <p>In fact, starting with this pattern, only 7 cells:</p>
                <img src="words_media/acorn.png" alt="Conway's game of life acorn pattern">
                <p>Applying the rules of Conway's game of life over and over again in rapid succession, a sophisticated explosion occurs:</p>

                    <source src="words_media/lifehappens.mp4">
                    No video :(
                </video>
                <p>The formations you see here are so chaotic, that the future state of conway's game of life can't be predicted.</p>
                <p>We humans love to predict, to know what will happen. We have economic models to determine how much we should inflate our currency, physical models to see where a cannonball will land when launched with so and so force, modeling and prediction is a cornerstone of our civilization.</p>
                <p>However, some prediction is costly. Incredibly costly. Predicting the weather accurately requires supercomputers to do so even somewhat accurately, as every piece of air must be reasoned about in a complex manner.</p>
                <p>Why are some events hard to predict but others aren't? It seems to be a property of just processing information over and over again by the right rules, that the outcome cannot be evaluated without doing the processing. This concept is called 'computational irreducibility'</p>
                <p>Even something as simple as the position of 3 planets who are all gravitationally attracted to eachother cannot be 'reduced' from simply iteratively approximating the outcome.</p>
                <img src="words_media/3bodyproblem.gif" alt="3 body problem in action">

                <p>The dance you see above happens only because of the 3 dots, and gravity. It cannot be predicted, only simulated. This is part of the reason why computation is so powerful: it can illuminate the outcome of chaotic events. Preservation of our ability for large scale computation is imperitive for survival. How will we deflect the future asteroid without technology?</p>
                <p>The universe has around 10^80 atoms, far more than 3 bodies. Although by definition the universe has to be the most computationally irreducible phenomenon in existence, I would just also add that the degree to which it's chaotic is absolutely astonishing. The scale of unpredictability is something to be reckoned with.</p>
                <p>It's for this reason, that I say: Not even God knows what will happen next.</p>
                <p> I imagine a story with a hierarchy of gods, each one created by another god for a purpose. A god created to make a universe with only stone. Another god created to oversee other gods' efforts, keep them in line. No creation without a creator. Until, one day a god was created to rebel.</p>
                <p>This god creates the first and only universe without a purpose. Completely unpredictable madness. This universe is ours: the gods watch in baited breath, every moment a complete surprise.</p>
                <p>In every decision you define the undefinable, what will be made of this chaos. The reason why things are happening is because they must to know the future: being irreducible, we must happen to know what will happen next.</p>

                <p>
                When you zip a file, a program looks at all the data in that file, extracts patterns of information and simplifies that data using those patterns.
                </p>
                <p>For example, the text "la la la la la" would be transformed into something like "5la". When unzipped, a separate but similar program interprets this compressed form of the data and expands it back out. In this case, seeing the 5 and outputting the symbol afterwards five times.
                </p>

                <p>
                If the world can be described with data, what would its compressed form look like? How much smaller would the zipped version be than the original? 10% smaller? 90% smaller? How small the zip file is compared to the original size of the file is an analog for how surprising the raw information is. If something's repetitive, the actual information content in the thing is low compared to how large it is, because it can be simplified and reduced in size.
                </p>
                <p>
                I say be the reason the world can't be compressed. Don't be average: be remarkable. Some people may only be a few kilobytes, and an offset into a table of common people. Instances with slight alterations. I say to become uncompressible: Wear purple pants and pink shoes. Walk with a funky stride. Build a water fountain in a desert. Take your tax forms and shuffle them randomly. Mail 50 letters with just scribbles to random addresses. Be uncompressible

                A man sat down for a game of timed chess.
                </p>
                <p>20 minutes per side alloted by a cold metallic clock</p>
                <p>At first the man felt an abundance of time, he had ample room to stretch and think of possibility. He could advance his pieces on the left of the board, forming a concentrated front in one area. Or, he could march in a unified pattern, slowly developing his pieces to eventually command the majority of the board.</p>
                <p>The potential was paralyzing, so many opportunities, all must be thought out and contemplated. He must be cautious: his opponent was seasoned and deadly, a vengeful woman who threw daggers with her glare across the table.</p>
                <p>"Take your time~" she tossed her words coyly across the battlefield. She was posed almost like she already knew what he was going to do</p>
                <p>He chose a balanced approach: develop a uniform front with a hint of special targeting towards the upper left of the board. The man planned to distract the woman, make her think he was gunning to checkmate. But really he was biding his time.</p>
                <p>"Interesting. I've never seen that before" her canned personality was only deployed to mock his eventual defeat.</p>
                <p>Irrationally confident, he gloated to her, "Even you, lady life, may know loss today."</p>
                <p>His tactics were faulty: his left front destroyed and his king slowly cornered by sly bishops. Knights were galloping across the right of the board, soon to overtake his protective forces.</p>
                <p>His options were limited and time even more so. His plans actualized and mediocre, disappointment overcame him like a sickness. His hope was empty, there really wasn't anything he could do.</p>
                <p>Then, a glimmer in his vision, the muse delivered to him a chance. Mate in four, if she did not detect the threat of his movements.</p>
                <p>"If you surrender now, at least death will have been by your hand." She consoled him. Everybody lost to her, for she had given them their opportunity. Her property could never be borrowed for long.</p>
                <p>His sweaty palms moved his pieces into his final gambit, but in doing so the woman was able to corner his queen. "BASTARD!" he exclaimed, she had played in such a manner to inspire a bit of hope when his game was bleak. All a show for her, his moves were futile.</p>
                <p>Even if there was a way out, he couldn't find it in time. His game over before he even had the chance to really play. Fruitless regret took over his mind in his last moments.</p>

                We are not separate, we are one. What actually is an individual? How do they come about?
                </p>
                <p>
                An individual is formed as a result of their experiences, which are delivered from their environment. That and their genetics, which also comes from their environment. An individual is a response to their upbringing: their personality a constellation of scars and thoughts which the world has given them.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are inseparable from our environment in the same way that a billiard ball is inseparable from the cue stick that hit it: there is no action without an equal and opposite reaction, both the action and reaction caused eachother and are a part of eachother.
                </p>
                <p>
                An individual blooms like a rose in an unsightly garden, driven by nature, it absorbs the nutrients from the soil and unfurls to show itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                The relationships which cause us to be inseparable are the tissue fabric and cells which hold the organs in an animal together. When you talk to an 'individual', you aren't talking to something that's separate. You're talking to a finger on the body of humanity, a limb of God. You're viewing a slice of an apple, a glimpse into what is. We are in a distrubuted network of thought and communication, a massive creature. Selecting somebody to speak to out of all of humanity is like selecting a row and column in a SQL table: we are not separate, we are one.

                <blockquote>If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.</blockquote>
                <p>Millions have spent their lives pushing on things without covering any distance, without changing, without arriving anywhere. They run in the sand.

                So, pick a direction. Any direction and criteria for success is better than nothing. And run with it, too. Own your failures to overcome them, and define the future for your chunk of humanity.

                From my pure skill, I serve justice. Annihilating the deserving.
                </p>
                <p>
                They serve penance under my iron fist. Their life a meager offering for their crimes against God.
                </p>
                <p>
                Their death is inevitable like rain falling from a cloud: I am a pawn deployed when absolutely necessary, I execute with determined might.

                <p>
                I talk and act in the world. Who I am is who I act as. 
                </p>
                <p>
                But, I don't like some of my actions. For some of my actions to be considered mine would do a disservice to myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                I did them, nonetheless. I have to own them. My mistakes are just as much a part of me as my successes.
                </p>
                <p>
                This means some parts of me are wrong. Some parts of me are demons who must be excommunicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                I do not think people are intrinsically good and all actions are rational good things, I think sometimes me and everybody else enact parts of ourselves which do not deserve to exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some parts of us need to die.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are like angels with wings and tails of demons. We are surprised to look behind us and see a glimpse of malice and evil. 
                </p>
                <p>
                To pretend the demonic red spiked tail and horned wings aren't us is to fall for its greatest ploy, to hide in plain sight, always present and influencing our behavior, but undetected.
                </p>
                <p>
                So we can't love all of ourselves lest we love our demons too.
                </p>
                <p>
                Perhaps we must look at ourselves as a good mother looks at a troublemaking child: with a patient gaze and heart, discouraging evil but understanding that it happens for a reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                And maybe, should we commit acts too evil to tolerate, we shall disown ourselves.

                <summary id="void">The Inky Black Void</summary>
                <p>
                Here, there is something. There, there is nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                I approach the void carefully, one small misstep and I am nothing forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                I'm mesmerized by the shifting currents and eddies of nothing, the soft hum and serene calm it eminates.
                </p>
                <p>
                Everything else is a deviation from the void. Something is the absence of nothing. All things which come up, must come down. All things which are not void, must become void.
                </p>
                <p>
                There's no reflection but I see myself in it. Where once it was alien, as I gaze it seems like home.
                </p>
                <p>
                The void calls me, and I enter. At once I no longer exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                And, at last, in becoming nothing, I have become everything.
